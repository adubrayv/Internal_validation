The aim of the study is to compare the performance of split-validation, bootstrap, cross validation and nested cross validation with transcriptomic data using time-to event endpoint in a head and neck carcinomas simulation study to better assess the way we can ensure the stability of the predictive performance of a model using a large quantity of predictor with the problematic of right censored data.
Internal Validation process have to ensure performance nearest as possible of external validation approach.
As recommended in logistic regression, cross-validation approach seems to be stable and less optimist than the other approach.
We aimed to quantify the optimism bias and stability of these methods according to sample size using different penalized regression approach for selection of the models of interest.
